### Hi, I'm Duc 👋

- ❤ I love coding and creating something useful.
- ♒ My zodiac is Aquarius. Calm, quiet, rebellious and maybe eccentric 🙄
- 🤙 You may find me quiet the first time you meet, but trust me, once you get along with me, you won't be able to stop me from talking 😁
- 😅 Fun fact: Please don't care about my profile picture, it's my girlfriend. I just left avatar like that for the purpose of her not sulking me
